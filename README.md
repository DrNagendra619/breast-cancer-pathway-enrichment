# Pathway and Over-Representation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the results of a Pathway and Over-Representation Analysis performed using the [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) web tool. The analysis identifies key biological pathways and regulatory networks significantly enriched in the target gene set, providing insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.

## Key Biological Themes Identified

Based on the enrichment results, the data highlights three major biological themes:

### 1. Hormone Signaling & Mammary Development
A significant portion of the enriched pathways is dedicated to hormone regulation and breast tissue biology. 
* **Estrogen & Hormone Regulation:** The analysis highlights the Estrogen Receptor Pathway, alongside RUNX1's role in regulating Estrogen Receptor Mediated Transcription. Additionally, the Sulfatase And Aromatase Pathway and Estradiol Regulation are prominent.
* **Tissue Specificity:** The Mammary Gland Development Pathway and the Prolactin Signaling Pathway strongly suggest a focus on mammary cell signaling and breast cancer contexts.

### 2. Cell Cycle & Cancer Pathogenesis
The gene set is heavily involved in general cancer pathways and aggressive cell division mechanisms.
* **Oncogenic Pathways:** Broad cancer networks are highly enriched, including general PATHWAYS IN CANCER, the Retinoblastoma Gene In Cancer, and specific networks like Gastric Cancer Network 1.
* **Cell Cycle Control:** Critical stages of cell division are represented, including Cell Cycle, Mitotic, the Mitotic G1 Phase and G1 S Transition, and the G2 M Transition.
* **Tumor Suppression & Signaling:** Key regulatory checkpoints like the P53 SIGNALING PATHWAY and AURKA Activation by TPX2 are active.

### 3. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) & Metabolism
The analysis also reveals changes in the cellular microenvironment and metabolic processing.
* **ECM Interactions:** Pathways such as Fibronectin Matrix Formation and ECM-RECEPTOR INTERACTION indicate dynamic changes in how cells communicate with their surroundings, a common factor in tumor metastasis. Proteoglycans in cancer are also highly enriched.
* **Metabolic Shifts:** The presence of Pyrimidine Metabolism and Glutathione Metabolism points to the metabolic reprogramming required to sustain rapid cell growth and manage oxidative stress.

## Methodology
* **Tool:** [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)
* **Databases Queried:** The results span multiple pathway databases, visibly integrating data from established sources like WikiPathways, Reactome, and KEGG.
